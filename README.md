# SpaceHeater.exe - Generate extra heat for cold offices

First off, this program *could* kill your computer - so use at your own discretion/risk.

This program will run useless computations on 75% of your logical processors, to generate extra heat.  

Works best with multicore machines.

# What do I need to use this?

SpaceHeater requires .NET 4.0 Client or Full profile, as well as either Visual Studio or csc.exe to build the solution.
